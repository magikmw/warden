 Warden
 by Michał Walczak

 ----------
 A coffebreak roguelike created for the 7DRL Challenge 2012 (in ~63h of realtime).

 You are a Grey Warden at the end of your days. As countless others before you,
 you step into the Deep Roads to take on your last quest - to destroy
 as many darkspawn as you can before collapsing to blows or the corruption
 that is running in your veins.
 The game is (as may be obvious to some) based on the fluff from Dragon Age: Origins by BioWare.

 Keybindings:

 Arrows / numpad / vi-keys   -   Arrows / numpad arrows / vi-keys
 TAB                         -   Cycle interesting things on screen

 SHIFT + Q                   -   Exit to main menu (no saving!)

 The objectives:
 - Gain as many points as possible by killing monsters and descending
 - Seek out blade shards to gain access to the lower levels of the dungeon
 - Kill the Archdemon on level 10
 - Beat the highscore!

 Main mechanics:
 - Walk into things to attack (original idea! honest!)
 - Your stamina drains quickly in combat and while waiting,
     only killing monsters can replenish it with your rage
 - Find health potions to regain some lost strenght
 - Only cardinal directions are valid for movement
